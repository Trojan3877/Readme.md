# Corey Leath  
**AI / ML Engineer | Production-Grade Machine Learning Systems | MLOps & Applied AI**

I design, build, and continuously improve **end-to-end machine learning systems** with a focus on **real-world deployment, metrics, and scalability** — not toy notebooks.

My work emphasizes:
- Production ML pipelines (data → training → evaluation → inference)
- Measurable model performance (precision, recall, F1, confusion matrices)
- System design, modular architecture, and maintainability
- Applied AI across Computer Vision, Recommender Systems, and ML platforms

---

## Why follow this GitHub?

- 🔁 I iteratively upgrade projects to **production-grade ML standards (L5/L6 quality)**
- 📊 I publish **real evaluation metrics**, not placeholder results
- 🧠 I focus on **applied AI systems**, not academic-only demos
- 🛠️ I share **reusable ML patterns**, pipelines, and design decisions

If you care about *how ML actually works in production*, you’ll find value here.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a rising **Software Engineer and AI/ML Engineer** with strong foundations in:

- Full-stack development  
- Machine Learning & Computer Vision  
- Backend APIs (Python, FastAPI, Flask)  
- Quantitative systems & trading strategy backtesting  
- Systems programming in Python, Java, and C++  
- Cloud engineering, DevOps, and modern CI/CD
