# 👋 Meet Corey Leath

**Aspiring AI/ML Engineer | Tech Visionary | Faith-Driven Creator**

Hi, I'm **Corey Leath** — a passionate builder, creative mind, and resilient spirit on a mission to engineer a better world through Artificial Intelligence.

I’m currently pursuing **dual Bachelor's Degrees** in **Artificial Intelligence** and **Advancing Computer Science** at the University of Advancing Technology (UAT), alongside an Associate of Science in Engineering Technology (Machine Learning specialization) from DeVry University. I also attend the **Interview Kickstart Machine Learning Engineering bootcamp**, where I’m sharpening my skills for Big Tech, Big AI, and FinTech roles.

But I’m not just about code — I’m about **impact**.

## 🔧 My Work

I specialize in building **production-grade AI/ML systems** with a focus on:

- 🧠 Ethical Large Language Models (LLMs)
- 🎯 Computer Vision (Emotion Detection, Safety Systems)
- 📊 Quantitative Research Tools
- ⚙️ MLOps pipelines (Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD)
- ☁️ Cloud AI (AWS, Snowflake, FastAPI, Terraform)

Every project on this GitHub is built with:
- Clean, modular code with comments
- Quantifiable evaluation metrics
- Clear folder structure & professional documentation
- Real-world use cases and industry alignment

🧪 I believe in solving hard problems with empathy and intelligence.

## ❤️ What Drives Me

I’ve overcome incredible challenges—**mental health battles, foster care, trauma, and loss**—and I carry those experiences into my work.

I live with **schizoaffective disorder**, but I refuse to let it define me. Instead, I use it to **fuel empathy, purpose, and resilience** in everything I create.

I'm a proud believer in **God and Jesus**, a huge fan of **college football**, and a loyal lover of:
- 💻 Samsung products
- 🎮 Xbox gaming
- 🍽️ Good food
- 🐶 Dogs
- 🇺🇸 America

I’m not just building software. I’m building a future where **AI uplifts everyone**, especially those often left behind.

> 🧠 *“I build because I believe no one should be left behind in the age of AI.”*

# Readme.md
# AI and the Rise of Universal Basic Income  
### *A New Social Contract for the Age of Automation*  
📄 Written by Corey Leath | April 2025

---

## 🔍 Overview

As artificial intelligence continues to replace both low- and high-skill jobs, the world is approaching a major economic inflection point. This research paper explores the need for **Universal Basic Income (UBI)** as a humane and sustainable response to large-scale automation. It argues that UBI is not only an economic tool but also a moral imperative in an era where machines may outperform humans across industries.

---

## 🧠 Key Themes

- The impact of AI on skilled labor, including software engineering, design, healthcare, and logistics
- Quantifiable evidence from Oxford, WEF, and pilot programs in Finland & Stockton, CA
- The case for UBI as a buffer against permanent job displacement
- Economic, ethical, and societal risks of ignoring this transformation
- A call for **Ethics Boards** in every AI domain: Deep Learning, Generative AI, Robotics, and more
