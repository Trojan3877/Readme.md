## 🚀 About Me

I am an AI/ML-focused engineer currently completing my Bachelor's in Software Development (Web & Mobile Apps) while building a production-grade portfolio aimed at securing competitive **Machine Learning Engineering** and **AI Research** internships at companies such as **Nvidia, OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Stripe, Roblox, and Google**.

My mission is to become an elite **10x Machine Learning Engineer** who builds impactful, end-to-end AI systems—from data pipelines to model deployment—and contributes to real-world innovation that improves lives.

## 🏆 Portfolio Impact Summary (2025 Update)

### **Overall Portfolio Grade (After Latest Upgrades): B+**
*(High-Potential / Emerging A-Level)*

After completing the production-grade **Diabetes Prediction ML Pipeline**, my portfolio has shifted from student-level projects to **real ML Engineering systems**.

### What Improved:
- Fully modular `src/` package design  
- Config-driven architecture (YAML)  
- PyTest test suite  
- Model lifecycle (preprocess → train → evaluate → metrics)  
- FAANG-style documentation, diagrams, and badges  
- Demonstration of true engineering depth & reproducibility  

### Recruiter Signal Boost:
> “This candidate builds real systems, not toy models.”

### Current Strengths:
- Strong ML foundations  
- End-to-end pipeline architecture  
- High technical breadth (ML, CV, LLMs, Quant, Snowflake, Docker, K8s, Python, C++, Java)  
- Real projects showing engineering maturity
