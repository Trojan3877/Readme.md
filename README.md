## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a rising **Software Engineer and AI/ML Engineer** with strong foundations in:

- Full-stack development  
- Machine Learning & Computer Vision  
- Backend APIs (Python, FastAPI, Flask)  
- Quantitative systems & trading strategy backtesting  
- Systems programming in Python, Java, and C++  
- Cloud engineering, DevOps, and modern CI/CD  
- Mobile & web app design using React, React Native, and Firebase  

I currently hold an **A.S. in Engineering Technology (Machine Learning & Design Techniques)** and I am completing my **Bachelor’s in Software Development (Web & Mobile Applications)**.

Next, I plan to pursue a **Master’s in AI Engineering at UPenn**, followed by a **Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence**, to specialize in high-impact intelligent systems, advanced ML infrastructure, and automated decision-making.

My mission is to engineer systems that improve people’s lives — from finance and automation to healthcare and global-scale software platforms.
