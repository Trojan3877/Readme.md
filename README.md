# AI and the Rise of Universal Basic Income  
### *A New Social Contract for the Age of Automation*  
📄 Written by Corey Leath | April 2025

---

## 🔍 Overview

As artificial intelligence continues to replace both low- and high-skill jobs, the world is approaching a major economic inflection point. This research paper explores the need for **Universal Basic Income (UBI)** as a humane and sustainable response to large-scale automation. It argues that UBI is not only an economic tool but also a moral imperative in an era where machines may outperform humans across industries.

## 🧠 Key Themes

- The impact of AI on skilled labor, including software engineering, design, healthcare, and logistics
- Quantifiable evidence from Oxford, WEF, and pilot programs in Finland & Stockton, CA
- The case for UBI as a buffer against permanent job displacement
- Economic, ethical, and societal risks of ignoring this transformation
- A call for **Ethics Boards** in every AI domain: Deep Learning, Generative AI, Robotics, and more
